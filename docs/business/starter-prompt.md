I'm working with an agentic coding boilerplate project that includes authentication, database integration, and AI capabilities. Here's what's already set up:

## Current Agentic Coding Boilerplate Structure
- **Authentication**: Better Auth with Google OAuth integration
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL setup  
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI integration
- **UI**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **Current Routes**:
  - `/` - Home page with setup instructions and feature overview
  - `/dashboard` - Protected dashboard page (requires authentication)
  - `/chat` - AI chat interface (requires OpenAI API key)

## Important Context
This is an **agentic coding boilerplate/starter template** - all existing pages and components are meant to be examples and should be **completely replaced** to build the actual AI-powered application.

### CRITICAL: You MUST Override All Boilerplate Content
**DO NOT keep any boilerplate components, text, or UI elements unless explicitly requested.** This includes:

- **Remove all placeholder/demo content** (setup checklists, welcome messages, boilerplate text)
- **Replace the entire navigation structure** - don't keep the existing site header or nav items
- **Override all page content completely** - don't append to existing pages, replace them entirely
- **Remove or replace all example components** (setup-checklist, starter-prompt-modal, etc.)
- **Replace placeholder routes and pages** with the actual application functionality

### Required Actions:
1. **Start Fresh**: Treat existing components as temporary scaffolding to be removed
2. **Complete Replacement**: Build the new application from scratch using the existing tech stack
3. **No Hybrid Approach**: Don't try to integrate new features alongside existing boilerplate content
4. **Clean Slate**: The final application should have NO trace of the original boilerplate UI or content

The only things to preserve are:
- **All installed libraries and dependencies** (DO NOT uninstall or remove any packages from package.json)
- **Authentication system** (but customize the UI/flow as needed)
- **Database setup and schema** (but modify schema as needed for your use case)
- **Core configuration files** (next.config.ts, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.ts, etc.)
- **Build and development scripts** (keep all npm/pnpm scripts in package.json)

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Better Auth for authentication
- Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL
- Vercel AI SDK
- shadcn/ui components
- Lucide React icons

## AI Model Configuration
**IMPORTANT**: When implementing any AI functionality, always use the `OPENAI_MODEL` environment variable for the model name instead of hardcoding it:

```typescript
// ✓ Correct - Use environment variable
const model = process.env.OPENAI_MODEL || "gpt-5-mini";
model: openai(model)

// ✗ Incorrect - Don't hardcode model names
model: openai("gpt-5-mini")
```

This allows for easy model switching without code changes and ensures consistency across the application.

## Component Development Guidelines
**Always prioritize shadcn/ui components** when building the application:

1. **First Choice**: Use existing shadcn/ui components from the project
2. **Second Choice**: Install additional shadcn/ui components using `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name>`
3. **Last Resort**: Only create custom components or use other libraries if shadcn/ui doesn't provide a suitable option

The project already includes several shadcn/ui components (button, dialog, avatar, etc.) and follows their design system. Always check the [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) for available components before implementing alternatives.

## What I Want to Build
I want to build a trading platform , it can manage the trading healthcare services between healthcare services providers and insurance companies , the healthcare services can be presented in packages or general services and sell it quantities represented in health units , the health units can change and its equal 1 LYD in the beginning , each service can represented in health units  , the healthcare services can be sell in bulk with proper discount , there is calculator to help providers to manage and create their packages and services prices , the main page appears main menu to manage companies profiles and users login screen , the registration , the dashboards , the marketplace dashboard is market place  in  which the main screen appears for the registration of health companies and insurance companies, and the acceptance of key data, the manager's data, the data of the technical and medical company, the licenses to practice the profession and specialties, the bank's data, the registration of insurance companies, the director's data, the professional company data, the bank's data, the licenses to practice the profession, as well as the registration of investors, personal data, work data, financial statements, and the bank, after registration, health services companies can access the code platform. ICD11 Certain services are selected and priced according to a pricing mechanism and calculator that we will work on later and to sell these medical services at the price of medical units and make them available to wholesale insurance companies and advance sales with significant discounts, and the insurance companies get these offers from a display board that shows the companies and clinics that provide these services and are working to buy them and pay their costs in advance through the various Libyan payment tools, and when the insurance companies enter, they can review what is provided by the health companies and the beneficiaries of the offers and choose what suits it and enables it to view an index board for the purchased services and their management, and the consumers can buy and sell medical and services priced in negotiable medical units, and accordingly it will have a general index board, and each party can manage its file, manage its offers and purchases, and issue reports, can you think and produce an integrated platform for that in any language and to display it to the owners of the reformer.

## Request
Please help me transform this boilerplate into my actual application. **You MUST completely replace all existing boilerplate code** to match my project requirements. The current implementation is just temporary scaffolding that should be entirely removed and replaced.

## Final Reminder: COMPLETE REPLACEMENT REQUIRED
**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Do not preserve any of the existing boilerplate UI, components, or content. The user expects a completely fresh application that implements their requirements from scratch. Any remnants of the original boilerplate (like setup checklists, welcome screens, demo content, or placeholder navigation) indicate incomplete implementation.

**Success Criteria**: The final application should look and function as if it was built from scratch for the specific use case, with no evidence of the original boilerplate template.

## Post-Implementation Documentation
After completing the implementation, you MUST document any new features or significant changes in the `/docs/features/` directory:

1. **Create Feature Documentation**: For each major feature implemented, create a markdown file in `/docs/features/` that explains:
   - What the feature does
   - How it works
   - Key components and files involved
   - Usage examples
   - Any configuration or setup required

2. **Update Existing Documentation**: If you modify existing functionality, update the relevant documentation files to reflect the changes.

3. **Document Design Decisions**: Include any important architectural or design decisions made during implementation.

This documentation helps maintain the project and assists future developers working with the codebase.

Think hard about the solution and implementing the user's requirements.
